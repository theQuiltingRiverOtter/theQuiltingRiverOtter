- My name is Megan Buck. I am an aspiring web developer/software engineer about to retire from the US Air Force. 

- I am currently studying web development through a Udemy course "Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp 2021" and "The Odin Project." I am about to begin a coding bootcamp with Code Platoon. My repositories are a combination of personal projects and projects built for The Odin Project and the Udemy course. I will improve them as I learn more about web development.

- I hope to obtain a job as a junior web developer near Augusta, GA within the next year. I would prefer to work in back-end development, or in front-end development with a a emphasis on Javascript.
