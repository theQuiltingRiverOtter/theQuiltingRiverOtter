- My name is Megan Buck, I am currently serving in the US Air Force. I am interested in a job in web development after I retire. 
I am currently learning web development through a Udemy course and The Odin Project.
I am not currently looking to collaborate, because I would like to have the foundation knowledge of javascript before I begin collaborating.
